# grommet-v1
A mapping of v1 component signatures to v2 implementations

## Usage

- add dependency on `grommet-v1`
- update `grommet` dependency to `"grommet": "^2.0.0",`
- convert import statements to reference 'grommet-v1' instead of 'grommet'

NOTE: Not all components and properties are mapped. This is meant to help with the migration from v1 to v2.
